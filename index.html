        Sports are a popular form of entertainment. Many international sporting events are organised from time to time. Most of the events are sponsored by multinational manufacturing companies and business firms. They pay for the sports events in exchange for the right to advertise their products during those events. These events are telecast worldwide by satellite and people all over the world watch them live. As a result, the sponsor's products receive maximum media coverage giving companies international recognition. This is the only commercial aspect of international sport but there are other aspects too.
